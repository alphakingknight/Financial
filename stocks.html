        <h1> What Are Stocks? </h1>
        <p> A stock, also known as equity, is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of the issuing
            corporation.
            Units of stock are called "shares" which entitles the owner to a proportion of the corporation's assets and
            profits
            equal to how much stock they own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stocks are bought and sold predominantly on stock exchanges and are the foundation of many individual
            investors'
            portfolios. Stock trades have to conform to government regulations meant to protect investors from
            fraudulent
            practices.

        <h3> Understanding Stocks</h3>
        Corporations issue stock to raise funds to operate their businesses and the holder of stock, a shareholder, may
        have a claim to part of the company's assets and earnings.
        <p>
            A shareholder is considered an owner of the issuing company, determined by the number of shares an investor
            owns
            relative to the number of outstanding shares. If a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one
            person
            owns 100 shares, that person would own and have a claim to 10% of the company's assets and earnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stockholders do not own a corporation but corporations are a special type of organization because the law
            treats
            them as legal persons. Corporations file taxes. can borrow, can own property, and can be sued. The idea that
            a
            corporation is a “person” means that the corporation owns its assets. A corporate office full of chairs and
            tables belongs to the corporation, and not to the shareholders.
        </p>
        <p>

            Corporate property is legally separated from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of
            both
            the corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may order all of its assets
            sold
            but a shareholder's assets are not at risk. The court cannot force you to sell your shares, although the
            value
            of your shares may have fallen. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes bankrupt, they cannot sell the
            company’s
            assets to pay their creditors.
