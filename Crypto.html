        <h1> What is Cryptocurrency? </h1>
        <p> Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. It’s a
            peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical
            money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital
            entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the
            transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009 and remains the best known today. Much of
            the interest in cryptocurrencies is to trade for profit, with speculators at times driving prices skyward.
        </p>

        <h3> How Works?</h3>
        Cryptocurrencies run on a distributed public ledger called blockchain, a record of all transactions updated and
        held by currency holders.
        <p>
            Units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining, which involves using computer power to
            solve complicated mathematical problems that generate coins. Users can also buy the currencies from brokers,
            then store and spend them using cryptographic wallets.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you own cryptocurrency, you don’t own anything tangible. What you own is a key that allows you to move a
            record or a unit of measure from one person to another without a trusted third party.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Bitcoin has been around since 2009, cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain technology are
            still emerging in financial terms, and more uses are expected in the future. Transactions including bonds,
            stocks, and other financial assets could eventually be traded using the technology.Although Bitcoin has been
